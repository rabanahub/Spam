# Spam
we'll build a TensorFlow-based Spam detector; in simpler terms, we will have to classify the texts as Spam or Ham.

**Introduction to Naive Bayes**

With the increase in online consumption of products and services, consumers are facing a huge problem of abundance of spam messages in their inboxes which are either promotional-based or fraudulent. But due to this the messages/Email which is of much importance are squashed under the spam messages.

In this article, we are going to create an SMS spam detection model which will help you to find whether an SMS is a spam or not using Naive Bayes and Natural Language Processing(NLP).

**Gathering and Loading Data**

For this particular project, we will be using the dataset available on the Kaggle SMS Spam Collection Dataset which has a set of SMS-tagged messages in English that have been classified as being ham (‘legitimate’) and spam. Each line holds one message. Two columns make up each line:v1 carries the label such as (spam or ham) and v2 contains the actual content.
